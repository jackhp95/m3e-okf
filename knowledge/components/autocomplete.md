Autocomplete is a [text field](/components/text-field) that filters and suggests matching
options as the user types, combining free text entry with a constrained set of choices. It
suits long option lists where typing to narrow is faster than scanning.

## Anatomy

A text field with an attached list of suggestions that updates as the user types; choosing a
suggestion fills the field. Depending on configuration, the user may be limited to listed
options or allowed to enter free text.

## Usage

Use autocomplete when the option set is large enough that a [select](/components/select) would
be tedious to scroll and typing to filter is natural — a country, a recipient, a tag. Make
clear whether free text is accepted or only listed options are valid, and show a helpful empty
state when nothing matches. See [search](/patterns/search) for search-oriented suggestion flows.

## Accessibility

The field exposes that it has an associated suggestion list and its expanded state; suggestions
are navigable by keyboard; the active suggestion is announced; and choosing or dismissing keeps
focus sensible. See [forms](/patterns/forms).
