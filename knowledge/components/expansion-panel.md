An expansion panel is a titled section that expands to show its content and collapses to hide
it, letting a surface stay scannable while keeping detail one interaction away. A stack of
them forms an accordion.

## Anatomy

A header showing a title and an expand/collapse affordance, with a content region that
appears when expanded. The header's state indicates whether the content is showing.

## Usage

Use expansion panels for progressive disclosure — FAQs, optional settings, secondary detail —
where showing everything at once would overwhelm. Keep headers descriptive so the user can
decide whether to expand. Do not hide essential, always-needed content behind a collapse.

## Accessibility

The header exposes its expanded/collapsed state and controls the associated content region,
so assistive technology announces whether it is open; the state is signaled beyond color; the
header is keyboard-operable. See
[color-only state signaling](/anti-patterns/color-only-state-signaling).
