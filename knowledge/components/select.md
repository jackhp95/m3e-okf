A select presents a single field that, when activated, reveals a list of options for the
user to choose from. It saves space compared with showing every option inline, at the cost
of hiding the options until opened.

## Anatomy

A field showing the current selection (or a placeholder) with an affordance indicating it
opens; activating it reveals an overlay list of [options](/implementations/m3e-web/components/option),
the chosen one reflecting back into the field.

## Usage

Use a select for one choice among many options where showing all of them inline would
crowd the layout. When the set is short and worth seeing at a glance, a
[radio group](/components/radio-group) or [segmented button](/components/segmented-button)
keeps the options visible. When the user needs to filter a long list by typing, an
autocomplete fits better.

## Accessibility

The field has a label, exposes its current value and its expanded/collapsed state, and is
fully keyboard-operable — open, move through options, choose, and dismiss. Focus returns to
the field on close. See [forms](/patterns/forms) and [menu](/components/menu).
