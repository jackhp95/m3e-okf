A badge is a small marker overlaid on another element — an icon, an avatar, a navigation
destination — to signal a count of items or the presence of new activity.

## Anatomy

Either a small dot (presence only) or a compact numbered pill (a count), positioned at the
corner of its host element. It is decoration on top of the host, not a control itself.

## Usage

Use a badge to draw attention to unseen or pending items, such as unread messages on a
navigation icon. Keep numbers short, capping large counts (for example, "99+"). Do not
overload a UI with badges, or they stop signaling importance.

## Accessibility

A badge's meaning is exposed to assistive technology, not left as a purely visual dot — the
count or "new items" state is part of the host's accessible description. Because a bare dot
relies on color and position, ensure the underlying information is available in text too.
