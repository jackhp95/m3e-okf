A card is a contained surface that groups content and actions about a single subject —
an item in a feed, a summary, a piece of media. It comes in elevated, filled, and outlined
variants that differ in how they separate from the background.

## Anatomy

A shaped container holding content (text, media, controls) as a unit. It may be static or,
when the whole card represents one target, interactive.

## Usage

Use a card to package related content into a scannable unit, especially in a
[feed](/patterns/feed). Keep one subject per card. If the entire card is clickable, make
that obvious and avoid burying separate interactive controls inside a clickable card in a
way that confuses which target is being activated.

## Accessibility

If the whole card is a single target, it is one focusable control with an accessible name;
if it contains distinct controls, each is independently reachable and the card itself is not
also a competing target. Content order in the markup follows the visual reading order. See
[accessibility](/foundations/accessibility).
