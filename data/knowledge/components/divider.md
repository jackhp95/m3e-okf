A divider is a thin line that separates content into groups. It is the lightest way to
signal a boundary, adding structure without the weight of a container or the emphasis of
whitespace alone.

## Anatomy

A single thin line, either full-width or inset to align with adjacent content. It is
decoration, not a control.

## Usage

Use a divider to separate groups within a [list](/components/list) or sections of content
where whitespace alone is not enough. Do not divide every item — a divider between each row
adds noise and defeats grouping. Prefer spacing for light separation and reserve dividers for
meaningful group boundaries.

## Accessibility

A divider is usually purely visual and not announced. When it marks a genuine semantic
boundary (a group change), that grouping is conveyed through structure — headings or grouped
markup — not by the line alone. See [accessibility](/foundations/accessibility).
