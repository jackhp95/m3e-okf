An icon button performs an action using only an icon, with no visible text label. Its
compactness suits toolbars, list rows, and other dense contexts where a full
[button](/components/button) would not fit, and it comes in emphasis variants (from filled
down to standard) like other buttons.

## Anatomy

A single icon inside an interactive target, optionally within a shaped container that
carries the emphasis color. The visible glyph is smaller than the target it sits in.

## Usage

Use an icon button when the action is well represented by a familiar icon and space is
tight. Prefer a labeled button when the icon's meaning is not obvious. A toggle icon
button that switches between two states must make the state clear by more than color.

## Accessibility

Because there is no visible text, an icon button **must** carry an explicit accessible
name describing its action — the glyph itself is decorative and not announced. It keeps
the minimum interactive target even though the glyph is small, and any toggle state is
exposed to assistive technology. See [accessibility](/foundations/accessibility).
