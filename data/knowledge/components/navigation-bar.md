A navigation bar is a horizontal bar of top-level destinations, anchored at the bottom edge,
suited to **compact** width (phones). It keeps a few primary sections one tap away.

## Anatomy

A row of destinations, each an icon with a short label; the current destination is marked
active. It holds roughly three to five destinations.

## Usage

Use a navigation bar for the top-level sections of an app on compact screens. Keep the
destination set small and stable. As width grows, the same destinations move to a
[navigation rail](/components/navigation-rail) (medium) or drawer (expanded) — see
[navigation](/patterns/navigation). Do not put per-screen actions here; those belong to an
[app bar](/components/app-bar) or [FAB](/components/fab).

## Accessibility

The bar is exposed as navigation, the current destination is announced and signaled beyond
color, and each destination is keyboard-reachable with an accessible name. See
[color-only state signaling](/anti-patterns/color-only-state-signaling).
