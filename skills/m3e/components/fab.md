**Family:** [Actions & buttons](../concepts/choosing-components.md#actions) · See also: [button](button.md), [icon-button](icon-button.md), [fab-menu](fab-menu.md), [split-button](split-button.md), [button-group](button-group.md), [segmented-button](segmented-button.md)

The `m3e-fab` component is a prominent, expressive UI component that represents the primary action on a screen. Designed according to Material Design 3 guidelines, it supports seven visual variants, specified using the `variant` attribute—`primary`, `primary-container`, `secondary`, `secondary-container`, `tertiary`, `tertiary-container` and `surface`—each with dynamic elevation and adaptive color theming. The component is accessible by default, with ARIA roles, contrast-safe color tokens, and strong focus indicators. It can be extended to display a label alongside its icon, and responds to interaction states (hover, focus, press, disabled) with smooth motion transitions, elevation changes, and adaptive color theming. It can also function as a link or be used to submit form data. Native disabled `<button>` elements cannot receive focus. This can be problematic in some cases because it can prevent you from telling the user why the button is disabled. You can use the `disabled-interactive` attribute to style a `m3e-fab` as disabled but allow for it to receive focus. The button will have `aria-disabled="true"` for assistive technology.

```ts
import "@m3e/web/fab";
```

## Examples

```html
<m3e-fab>
  <m3e-icon>add</m3e-icon>
</m3e-fab>
```

```html
<m3e-fab extended>
  <m3e-icon>add</m3e-icon>
  <span slot="label">Add</span>
</m3e-fab>
```
