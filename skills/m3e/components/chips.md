**Family:** [Selection controls](../concepts/choosing-components.md#selection-inputs) · See also: [checkbox](checkbox.md), [radio-group](radio-group.md), [switch](switch.md), [slider](slider.md)

The `@m3e/web/chips` module provides expressive, accessible chip components for actions, input, filtering, and suggestions, each supporting two appearance variants—`outlined` and `elevated`. Use `outlined` for lightweight, unobtrusive chips such as tags or filters, and `elevated` for chips that require stronger visual affordance, like assist actions or selected states. These variants help convey interaction weight, visual hierarchy, and contextual emphasis across static and interactive use cases.

```ts
import "@m3e/web/chips";
```

**Elements:** `<m3e-chip>`, `<m3e-assist-chip>`, `<m3e-chip-set>`, `<m3e-filter-chip>`, `<m3e-filter-chip-set>`, `<m3e-input-chip>`, `<m3e-input-chip-set>`, `<m3e-suggestion-chip>`
