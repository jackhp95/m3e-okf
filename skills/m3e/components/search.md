**Family:** [Text input & forms](../concepts/choosing-components.md#text-inputs) · See also: [form-field](form-field.md), [select](select.md), [autocomplete](autocomplete.md), [textarea-autosize](textarea-autosize.md), [option](option.md)

The `m3e-search-bar` and `m3e-search-view` components provide a Material 3 expressive search experience. The search bar offers a prominent entry point for text input, while the search view presents suggestions, history, and results in contained, docked, or full screen configurations. Both components support ARIA accessibility, keyboard interaction, and theming via CSS custom properties.

```ts
import "@m3e/web/search";
```

**Elements:** `<m3e-search-bar>`, `<m3e-search-view>`

## Examples

```html
<m3e-search-bar clearable>
  <m3e-icon name="search" slot="leading"></m3e-icon>
  <input slot="input" placeholder="Search..." />
</m3e-search-bar>
```

```html
<m3e-search-view mode="docked" contained>
  <input slot="input" placeholder="Search..." />
  <m3e-list>
    <m3e-list-item>Result One</m3e-list-item>
    <m3e-list-item>Result Two</m3e-list-item>
    <m3e-list-item>Result Three</m3e-list-item>
  </m3e-list>
</m3e-search-view>
```
