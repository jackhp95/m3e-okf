**Family:** [Actions & buttons](../concepts/choosing-components.md#actions) · See also: [icon-button](icon-button.md), [fab](fab.md), [fab-menu](fab-menu.md), [split-button](split-button.md), [button-group](button-group.md), [segmented-button](segmented-button.md)

The `m3e-button` component is a semantic, expressive UI primitive users interact with to perform an action. Designed according to Material Design 3 guidelines, it supports five visual variants, specified using the `variant` attribute—`filled`, `tonal`, `elevated`, `outlined`, and `text`—each with dynamic elevation, shape morphing, and adaptive color theming. The component responds to interaction states (hover, focus, press, disabled) with smooth motion transitions, ensuring emotional clarity and visual hierarchy. The component is accessible by default, with ARIA roles, contrast-safe color tokens, and strong focus indicators. It supports optional icons and states for binary actions. When using `m3e-icon` for icons, `filled` is automatically set based on the selected state of a toggle button. It can also function as a link or be used to submit form data. Native disabled `<button>` elements cannot receive focus. This can be problematic in some cases because it can prevent you from telling the user why the button is disabled. You can use the `disabled-interactive` attribute to style a `m3e-button` as disabled but allow for it to receive focus. The button will have `aria-disabled="true"` for assistive technology.

```ts
import "@m3e/web/button";
```

## Examples

```html
<m3e-button variant="tonal">Tonal Button</m3e-button>
