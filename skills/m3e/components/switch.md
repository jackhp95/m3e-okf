The `m3e-switch` component is a semantic, accessible toggle control that reflects a binary state. Designed according to Material Design 3 guidelines, it supports shape transitions, and adaptive color theming across selected, unselected, and disabled states. The component responds to user interaction with smooth motion and expressive feedback. It supports optional icons (`none`, `selected`, or `both`) and integrates with form-associated behavior, emitting `input` and `change` events when toggled.

```ts
import "@m3e/web/switch";
```

## Examples

```html
<label>Switch label&nbsp;<m3e-switch></m3e-switch></label>
```

```html
<label>Switch label&nbsp;<m3e-switch icons="both"></m3e-switch></label>
```

## Compositions

_Validated against the manifest — every tag, attribute, slot, and union value checked against the CEM ground truth; pure Material composition, no custom CSS._

**Labelled switch with icons in both states**

```html
<label>Enable notifications&nbsp;<m3e-switch checked icons="both" name="notifications" value="enabled"></m3e-switch></label>
```

**Disabled switch**

```html
<label>Sync over cellular&nbsp;<m3e-switch disabled icons="selected"></m3e-switch></label>
```
