**Family:** [Actions & buttons](../concepts/choosing-components.md#actions) · See also: [button](button.md), [icon-button](icon-button.md), [fab](fab.md), [fab-menu](fab-menu.md), [split-button](split-button.md), [button-group](button-group.md)

The `m3e-segmented-button` and `m3e-button-segment` components allows users to select one or more options from a horizontal group. Each segment behaves like a toggle-able button, supporting icon and label content, selection state, and accessibility roles. Built with Material Design 3 principles, it adapts shape, color, and ripple feedback based on interaction state and input modality. Segments are visually unified but independently interactive.

```ts
import "@m3e/web/segmented-button";
```

**Elements:** `<m3e-button-segment>`, `<m3e-segmented-button>`

## Examples

```html
<m3e-segmented-button>

  <m3e-button-segment>16 oz</m3e-button-segment>
  <m3e-button-segment>20 oz</m3e-button-segment>
</m3e-segmented-button>
```
