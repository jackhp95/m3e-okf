# Color & theming

## Color

M3E applies the [Material Design 3 color system](https://m3.material.io/styles/color/system/overview) allowing you to create accessible and personalized color schemes that cascade to every component.

### Design tokens

The [Material Design 3 design tokens](https://m3.material.io/foundations/design-tokens/overview) are implemented as custom CSS properties. Design tokens are named, platform-agnostic variables that represent visual design decisions—such as color, typography, spacing, and elevation—in a reusable, consistent format.

Color tokens are surfaced using the standardized prefix `--md-sys-color-*` supporting use of the [Material Theme Builder](https://material-foundation.github.io/material-theme-builder/).

### Static color

Static colors refer to predefined, spec-aligned colors that do not automatically adapt to system settings. The `--md-sys-color-*` custom CSS properties default to the **baseline** values for light mode.

### Dynamic color

Dynamic color refers to runtime-generated color schemes derived from a single source color, allowing personalized theming that adapts to system settings.

M3E provides the [Theme](../components/theme.md) component which applies dynamic color, expressive motion, density, and strong focus indicators to nested, theme-aware elements. This component leverages the `@material/material-color-utils` library to generates light and dark variants based on the content strategy—mapping perceptually tuned tones to standard Material Design 3 roles like _primary_, _surface_, and _outline_.

### Forced colors

M3E honors `forced-colors` mode by dynamically adapting component styles to ensure legibility, contrast, and semantic clarity in high-contrast environments.
