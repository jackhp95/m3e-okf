# Density

## Density

Density refers to the spatial compactness of UI elements—how tightly components are arranged, how much padding surrounds them, and how much content fits within a given layout. M3E applies the [Material Design 3 density system](https://m3.material.io/foundations/layout/understanding-layout/density) to adapt component layout, spacing, and touch targets across varied contexts—from spacious, touch-friendly surfaces to compact, information-dense environments.

### Design tokens

The [Material Design 3 design tokens](https://m3.material.io/foundations/design-tokens/overview) are implemented as custom CSS properties. Design tokens are named, platform-agnostic variables that represent visual design decisions—such as color, typography, spacing, and elevation—in a reusable, consistent format.

Density tokens are surfaced using the standardized `--md-sys-density-scale` and `--md-sys-density-size` custom CSS properties. M3E provides the [Theme](../components/theme.html) component which can be used to systematically control `--md-sys-density-scale` using its `density` attribute.

### Density-aware components

The following components support density scaling: `autocomplete`, `breadcrumb`, `button-group`, `button`, `checkbox`, `chips`, `fab`, `form-field`, `icon button`, `list`, `menu`, `nav menu`, `paginator`, `radio-group`, `segmented button`, `select`, `split-button`, `switch`, `tabs`, `toolbar`, and `tree`. Each component adapts its layout, spacing, and touch targets based on the active density scale. Refer to the component's documentation for usage examples.

### Touch surfaces

Touch surfaces maintain a minimum size of `48dp x 48dp`, ensuring accessible, tap-friendly targets across all density settings. This threshold aligns with Material Design 3 guidelines and is enforced even in compact layouts, preserving interaction clarity and usability for both mouse and touch input.
