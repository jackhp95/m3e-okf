  Building web UIs with the M3E (Material 3 Expressive) web component library
  (@m3e/web, the matraic/m3e <m3e-*> custom elements). Use when adding, wiring,
  or styling m3e components — buttons, dialogs, lists, navigation, forms, chips,
  etc. — so component tags, attributes, slots, events, and CSS tokens are correct

# M3E — Material 3 Expressive web components

Correct, verified usage for the **@m3e/web** custom-element library
(`matraic/m3e`). Every component here is a real `<m3e-*>` custom element.

## How to use this skill (read only what you need)

1. **Not sure which component?** Read [`concepts/choosing-components.md`](concepts/choosing-components.md) — selection guidance by intent.
2. **Know the component?** Open **`components/<name>.md`** for its verified API —
   tags, attributes (exact types/defaults), slots, events, CSS properties, examples.
3. Import per component: `import "@m3e/web/<name>";` (ESM, tree-shakeable).
4. Cross-cutting concerns (theming, type, motion, framework setup) live in `concepts/`.
5. Don't guess attribute names/values from generic Material Design — the card is
   the source of truth. If a card lacks something, follow its source link.

## Concepts

- [Choosing components](concepts/choosing-components.md) — which component when
- [Color & theming](concepts/color.md) · [Density](concepts/density.md) · [Motion](concepts/motion.md) · [Typography](concepts/typography.md)
- [Getting started](concepts/getting-started.md) · [Installation](concepts/installation.md)
- Frameworks: [React](concepts/frameworks-react.md) · [Vue](concepts/frameworks-vue.md) · [Angular](concepts/frameworks-angular.md)

## Conventions

- All tags are prefixed `m3e-`. Many components export several elements
  (e.g. `chips` → `m3e-chip-set`, `m3e-filter-chip`, …) — see the card.
- Boolean attributes follow the HTML convention (present = true).
- Icons use `m3e-icon` (see the `icon` component card).
- Theming uses Material `--md-sys-*` design tokens — see [Color & theming](concepts/color.md).
